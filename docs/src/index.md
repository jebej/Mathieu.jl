# Mathieu.jl

A package for computing integer order Mathieu functions and characteristic values.

The notation used here mirrors the one in NIST's [Digital Library of Mathematical Functions](https://dlmf.nist.gov/28).

The methods used to compute the functions and characteristic values are based on matrix diagonalization, and are explained in more details in [Cojocaru 2008](https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1970).
